### Summary
WHHW is an intuitive way to search for events and NYT articles on a certain day, primarily a persons birthday. It pulls from the NYT API from their database of articles and from the another API for famous events in history. It then allows users to input their name or a name of their choice and share an article of their choosing to the social panel over on the left hand side of the screen

### The goal of this project
The goal was to make a simple page and catch the attention of potentially a room full of people with a quick, easy, and unique social experience based around dates in history. 

### File Structure
The project is made esentially with one page styled using the materialize CSS library, and interacting with Two different API's to retrieve information. To share that information, the side pushes and pulls from a firebase table into a share section on the left. 

### Instructions
Input your name and your desired date, usually the users birthday, and then click submit. Then the app will pull information from its two API's about relative articles and events and display them down below in two collumns. Then, if a user desires, you can share an event by clicking the button next to the article. The last 30 shared articles will reflected on the left.
