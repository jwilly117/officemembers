# The Office (Us Version) Random Employee Game
<br>

### Summary
This small game is basically a "click a random picture" game I'm using to demonstrate building different components in React. 

### The goal of this project
Since this was near the first page I have done in react, the Goal is simply to demonstrate in code how different components could come together to present an entire page. 

### File Structure
The file structure is relatively basic, demonstrating the creation of 8 components and then calling them into a single component, and then that component into the App.js file, which will render to the DOM. 

### How to play
Click any employee to start playing, all of the employees are either win or loss, and get randomized after every click!
Try to remember who you have clicked as well, dont click the same employee twice.

### Future of this project
In the future i'd like to refine the site to utilize more components and perhaps with different tabs for different small, component based games. All using React, as it is the main focus of this practice.
